Steps: 

1. Check out your Java project with `git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin.git` 
2. Go into repository with `cd incubator-zeppelin`
3. Select your project with `cd zeppelin-web`
4. Build it with `~/maven/bin/mvn clean package -DskipTests`
5. The compiled archive is called `zeppelin-web-0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT.war`

Your files are now in ***incubator-zeppelin/zeppelin-web/target***!
