Steps: 

1. Install a library for web with `sudo pip install requests`
2. Change into your directory with `cd ~/Downloads`
3. Execute the program with `python download.py`  
4. Try following code below:

{% highlight python %}
# Load the library
import requests

# Make an URL request 
r = requests.get('http://bit.ly/1WlCvyJ')
# File name and open it for binary writing 
with open('test.jpg', 'wb') as f:
    # Download the bytes
    f.write(r.content)
{% endhighlight %}

Your file is now in ***~/Downloads/test.jpg***!
